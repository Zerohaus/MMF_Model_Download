New Features:
✅ Cookie Validation - Checks for PHPSESSID and cf_clearance before starting
✅ Test Mode - Run with --test flag to verify setup with one file first
✅ HTML Error Detection - Catches "enable Javascript" pages automatically
✅ Consecutive Failure Protection - Stops after 3 failures in a row (systematic error)
✅ Better Error Messages - Shows actual error content and troubleshooting steps
✅ Detailed Cookie Instructions - Step-by-step guide in the script header
✅ Early Exit - Won't download 157 error pages before noticing something's wrong

Key Improvements:

Test mode will catch the issue immediately:

bash mmf_download_stl_files_enhanced.sh --test

This downloads ONE file and validates it before proceeding.

2.  Cookie validation checks for cf_clearance - 
    The "enable Javascript" error is almost always missing this Cloudflare token
4.  Shows the actual error page content so they can see what MyMiniFactory is returning
5.  Stops after 3 consecutive failures instead of downloading 157 HTML error pages

Replace your script with this enhanced version
Run [bash mmf_download_stl_files_enhanced.sh --test] first
If test fails, follow the error message instructions to get a fresh cookie
