# MyMiniFactory - Mass ZIP Extraction Script
# Extracts all ZIP files in all model subdirectories
# WINDOWS ONLY - Requires PowerShell 5.0+
#
# This is OPTIONAL Step 3 - run after downloading STL/ZIP files
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Completed Steps 1 & 2 (metadata and STL downloads)
# - PowerShell execution policy allows scripts
# - Close any Windows Explorer windows viewing the files
#
# Usage:
# 1. Update $BASE_PATH variable below to point to your stl_files directory
# 2. Choose extraction mode (in-place or separate folders)
# 3. Run: .\extract_all_zips.ps1

# ============================================================================
# CONFIGURATION - UPDATE THIS PATH TO YOUR stl_files DIRECTORY
# ============================================================================
# Example Windows paths:
# $BASE_PATH = "C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\MyMiniFactory\downloads\stl_files"
# $BASE_PATH = "D:\3D Printing\MMF Downloads\downloads\stl_files"
$BASE_PATH = "PATH\TO\YOUR\downloads\stl_files"

# Choose extraction mode:
# $EXTRACT_IN_PLACE = $true   -> Extract directly into model folders alongside zips
# $EXTRACT_IN_PLACE = $false  -> Create separate "_extracted" subdirectories
$EXTRACT_IN_PLACE = $true

# Common Issues and Solutions:
#
# 1. "Base path does not exist" - Update $BASE_PATH to your actual stl_files directory path
# 2. "Access denied" or extraction fails - Close Windows Explorer windows viewing those folders
# 3. Script won't run - Run: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
# 4. Slow extraction - Large files (100MB+) take time, this is normal
# 5. Out of disk space - Check free space, each model can be 200MB+ extracted
#
# Tips:
# - Use in-place extraction ($EXTRACT_IN_PLACE = $true) to keep things organized
# - Close all Explorer windows before running to avoid file lock issues
# - Extraction can take 10-30 minutes depending on file count and sizes
# - You can delete the ZIP files after successful extraction to save space
# - STL files are typically in the extracted folders, ready for slicing software
